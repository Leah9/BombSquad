#### Tagret Audience

* Learn a new word or two
* Try and get a high score

## User stories

* I am a user looking to learn a new word.
* I am a user just looking to fill 5 minutes..
* I am a parent looking to keep my child occupied for a few minutes..

## Design choices

My design choices are to make an exciting looking game that can be played on all devices from phones to desktop PC within a browser.
## Wireframe
I have created wireframe views of the three pages that the site will have based on my required sections. I used wireframe.cc to complete this task.

#### API Ninjas

https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword
The following example code is from API-Ninjas.com and has been used as the basis for my API call. My API key is kmQ6b+eEy1yibeOtEmGp2g==IgpoxGkqjCuD6Cbh for testing. It will be changed once deployed to avoid abuse.
```javascript
const request = require('request');

request.get({
  url: 'https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/randomword',
  headers: {
    'X-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
}, function(error, response, body) {
  if(error) return console.error('Request failed:', error);
  else if(response.statusCode != 200) return console.error('Error:', response.statusCode, body.toString('utf8'));
  else console.log(body)
});
```
